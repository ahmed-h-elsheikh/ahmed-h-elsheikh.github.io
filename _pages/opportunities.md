### PhD studentships in geological modelling using deep-learning techniques

In this project, generative machine learning models (e.g. GANs among other techniques) will be investigated/adapted to generate geologically consistent subsurface models. The project will build on the recent work on the topic [1, 2, 3] and aims to address the questions of learning using limited training data, handling non-stationary spatial geological models and large scale 3D models.

### PhD studentships in efficient multiscale modeling using machine learning

Simulation of multiphase flow in fractured porous media is a challenging task given the inherent uncertainties in the porous media properties, fractures geometry and fractures properties. The high permeability contrast between the fractures and the background porous material (Matrix) results in a multi-scale flow features that are difficult to capture without extensive computing resources. The goal of this project is to develop data-driven upscaling methods for fractured reservoirs using modern deep learning techniques to address multi-query tasks including uncertainty propagation, risk assessment, flow control and optimization. The upscaled models will act as an accurate proxy for the full-scale flow simulations in fractured media. 

**Essential skills**:
- master’s degree in computational mathematics, physics or in a relevant engineering discipline with strong computational skills.
